We are happy to announce the release of `odoc` 2.3.0! In addition to
many bugfixes and small improvements, this release brings two
important features that we'd like to highlight: table support, and
source code rendering.

## Table support

Table support is the last addition to the odoc language, after
math. Odoc supports two markup to include tables: a light one, and a
heavy one. The light markup is similar to markdown's markup for table,
producing tables that are readable in the source file as
well.

However, this markup has some limitation, since it only allows inline
content in cells. It can also be difficult to read and mantain for big
tables, without a proper editor support. For this reason, Odoc also
provides a "heavy" markup, closer to the html one, with fewer limitations!

Here is a table in heavy, light, and rendered form:

```
{t
  Table | support
  ------|--------
  is    | cool!
}
```
```
{table
  {tr {th Table} {th support}}
  {tr {td is} {td cool!}}
}
```

Table | support
------|--------
is    | cool!

## Source code rendering

Source code rendering is an extremely exciting new feature. Not only
`odoc` is now able to generate a rendering of the source files (and
source hierarchy) of a project, but it is also able to create direct
links from the documentation to the implementation!

This puts the documentation browsing to a new level, by helping to
quickly answer any implementation-related question!

The source code rendering is also tailored to OCaml, for instance with
links from variables to their definition, something missing from
traditional html-based source viewing such as github!
